## Instructions
1. Use the example.cnf file to create a configuration file for you db

## Things to do:
1. Add all variables to conf file (hanoi home, db name, etc)
2. Options to backup different dbs (postgres, mysql)
3. Add option to choose how many tapes
4. Add table of coverage of each number of tapes
5. Figure out the formula to generate the list for infinite tapes so no need to pregenerate tape rotation arrays.
6. Add ways to send backups offsite (integrate with AWS S3?)
